[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

Grid block is one of the container blocks that can be used to organize multiple blocks and adjust the height, width, and position of all blocks inside the container. As a container block, it’s possible to transform a Grid block into a Group, Row or Stack block without changing the content of the block.

Click the block inserter **(+)** icon to open the block inserter pop-up window and search for the *Grid* block. You can also use the keyboard shortcut /grid to quickly insert a Grid block.

Detailed instructions on adding blocks can be found [here](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/).

## Block toolbar

To view the block toolbar, click on the block, and the toolbar will be displayed.

Every block comes with unique toolbar icons. These block-specific controls allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The Grid block shows the following buttons in the block toolbar:

- Moving handles
- Align
- Options

### Transform to

### Moving handles

The dotted icons can be used to drag and drop a block to the place of your choosing. The up and down arrow icons can be used to shift a block up and down in your document.

### Align

![Grid block Toolbar - Align button](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/08/grid-block-toolbar-align-6.6-300x181.jpg)Use the change alignment tool to change the width of the Grid block. The following is a list of the block width options:

- None
- Wide width
- Full width

### Options

The Options button on a block toolbar gives you more features to customize the block.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## Block settings

The block settings panel contains customization options specific to the block. To open it, select the block and click the cog icon next to the Publish button.

![Block settings icon on the editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/block-settings-icon.png)Click Group, Row, Stack button in the Block Settings to transform the Grid block to each block.

![Settings icons](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/08/grid-block-settings-6.6-300x191.jpg)### Layout

In the Grid block’s Layout settings, you can control how many columns appear in each row.

- **Max. columns** – Sets the maximum number of columns the grid can show in one row.
- **Min. column width** – Sets the smallest width each column can be before the grid wraps to fewer columns per row.

![Layout settings in the Grid block displaying min and max column inputs. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/09/grid-block-min-max-layout-settings-e1779252253461.png)Column optionsUse both settings when you want to cap the number of columns and control when the grid wraps to fewer columns.

For example, if Max. columns is 4 and Min. column width is 12rem, the grid can show 4 columns when there is enough space. On narrower screens, it may wrap to 3, 2, or 1 column.

### Position

The position setting is only available when the Grid block is located at the root-level. The drop-down menu has two options: **Default** and **Sticky**. If the Sticky option is selected, the Grid block will remain at the top of the window when you scroll down the page.
