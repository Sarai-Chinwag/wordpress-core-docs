[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/)

Due to Facebook’s [decision to close the oEmbed end ](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2020/08/04/Introducing-graph-v8-marketing-api-v8)point for embedding Facebook links, the block will not work anymore after October 24, 2020. Publishers who want to embed Facebook links into their sites will require a developer account and an appid, and provide an authentication token with their call to the endpoint. Facebook Documentation: [create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/)

WordPress leadership reached out to Facebook but it seems the policy change is final. Apart from alerting users here and in other places, WordPress contributors can’t do anything about it.

*Facebook Embed* block allows you to add Facebook posts to your post or pages. Keep in mind that the post needs to be *public* in order to add it.

![Facebook Embed block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/image6-1024x467.png)Besides Facebook Posts, you can also share links to Facebook Photos, Facebook Albums, and Facebook Videos.

Note that you can not embed Facebook pages, Facebook events, and Facebook groups.

Embedding a Facebook post is as simple as following these steps:

1. Copy the preferred link from the Facebook post you want to embed. Make sure it’s a public post.

![Copy the preferred link from a Facebook post

From the WordPress dashboard, go to your post and click the (+) icon to open the block inserter pop-up window and search for the *Facebook* block. You can also use the keyboard shortcut /facebook to quickly insert a *Facebook* block.

![Block toolbar for the Facebook embed block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-16-at-10.51.37-AM.png)The block toolbar contains the tools to customize each block. The *Facebook*  block’s toolbar consists of the following tools:

**Transform to**

![Transform tool in the Facebook embed block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/image10.png)You can transform a *Facebook embed* into a Group. This would give you the ability to change the background color around the *Facebook embed*.

**Block-moving tools**

![Block moving tools in the Facebook embed block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/image5.png)Use the block-moving tools to move the block up and down inside the editor. Use the six dots icon to drag and drop the *Facebook* block and reposition it anywhere on the editor. Alternatively, click on the up and down arrows to move the block up or down the editor.

**Change alignment**

![Change alignment in the Facebook embed block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/image8-1024x492.png)- **Align left** – Make the Facebook post left aligned
- **Align center** – Make the Facebook post alignment centered
- **Align right** – Make the Facebook post align right
- **Wide width** – Increase the width of the post beyond the content size
- **Full width** – Extend the Facebook post to cover the full width of the screen.

**Note:** *“Wide width” and “Full width” alignments need to be enabled by the Theme of your site.*

**More options**

![More options in the Facebook embed block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-16-at-10.59.04-AM.png)These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-options/)

## Block Settings

The block settings panel contains customization options specific to the block. To open it, select the block and click the cog icon next to the Publish button.

![How to show the block settings sidebar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/image4.png)Besides the Advanced section, the Facebook embed has only one setting in the “Block Settings” sidebar: Media Settings.

**Media settings**

![Media settings turned off in the Facebook embed block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-20-at-9.29.46-AM.png)![Media settings turned on in the Facebook embed block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-20-at-9.29.55-AM.png)Via the *Media Settings* you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**“Off:”** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position the toggle switch is gray.

**“On:”** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced settings**

The “Advanced” tab lets you add CSS class(es) to your block. This will allow you to write custom CSS and styles to the block.
